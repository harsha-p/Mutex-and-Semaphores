This is a small project to unserstand how to use process synchronization in C.
This gives a good overview of the mutex, semaphore and shared memory.

In total there are 3 programs:
1. Concurrent Merge Sort using mutex
2. Vaccination Drive Simulation using semaphores
3. Music Concert simulation using semaphores
